# Clustering Analysis of the Iris Dataset: KMeans and Hierarchical Techniques

## Objective
This project aims to evaluate the application of clustering techniques on a real-world dataset, specifically the Iris dataset. By implementing KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering, we explore unsupervised learning methods to identify patterns in the data.

---

## Dataset
We use the **Iris dataset** from the `sklearn` library. This dataset contains measurements of iris flowers across three species, but since this is a clustering problem, the species column is excluded during preprocessing.

## Key Components

### 1. Loading and Preprocessing (1 Mark)
- **Task**: Load the Iris dataset using the `sklearn` library.
- **Steps**:
  - Drop the species column to focus on clustering without predefined labels.

### 2. Clustering Algorithm Implementation (8 Marks)

#### A. KMeans Clustering (4 Marks)
- **Description**:
  - KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions the data into a predefined number of clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance.
- **Relevance to Iris Dataset**:
  - KMeans is effective for well-separated data like the Iris dataset.
- **Implementation**:
  - Apply KMeans clustering on the preprocessed dataset.
  - Visualize the resulting clusters using scatter plots.

#### B. Hierarchical Clustering (4 Marks)
- **Description**:
  - Hierarchical clustering builds nested clusters by merging or splitting them iteratively.
- **Relevance to Iris Dataset**:
  - This method provides a dendrogram for a detailed view of data structure.
- **Implementation**:
  - Apply Hierarchical clustering on the preprocessed dataset.
  - Visualize the clusters using dendrograms and scatter plots.

### 3. Timely Submission (1 Mark)
- Ensure the notebook is submitted on time and meets clarity standards.

## Submission Guidelines
- Code is provided in a **Jupyter Notebook** format.
- The repository includes:
  - **Clustering Implementation Notebook**: The full implementation with clear explanations and visualizations.
  - **Visualizations**: Cluster scatter plots and dendrograms.
  - **Documentation**: Concise descriptions of methods, explanations of clustering algorithms, and their relevance.
